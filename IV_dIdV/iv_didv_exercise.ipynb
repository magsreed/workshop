    "This is a notebook which should help set you up to practice and understand the SPICE/HERALD IV/dIdV sweep processing and analysis. Sections of this notebook are left blank on purpose, as the notebook is intended to be utilized interactively. This notebook is the practical exercise portion of a series of introductory presentations on the SPICE/HERALD analysis pipeline. Users should be working their way through the appropriate presentation BEFORE using this notebook, as many things are made more clear there. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this notebook contains useful theory, students should also be referred to appropriate theses and other readings. Some of the theory covered here is largely introductory, and meant to familiarize a new comer with terms, equations, and parameters. I found Sam Watkins thesis to be very friendly and informative, and of course, for an indepth study, the Bible of TES physics: Kent Irwin's Transition-Edge Sensors paper. Both of these can be found online.  "
